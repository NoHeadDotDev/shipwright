# Static Assets Directory

This directory contains the built static assets that are served by the web application.

## Structure

- `css/` - Compiled CSS files
- `js/` - Compiled JavaScript files  
- `vendor/` - Third-party libraries and assets

## Build Process

Assets are automatically copied from the `assets/` directory during the build process via `build.rs`.

- Source files: `assets/`
- Built files: `static/` (this directory)

## Development

When developing, make changes to files in the `assets/` directory, not directly in `static/`. The build process will handle copying and processing the files.

## Production

In production, these static files are served by the Axum web server using `tower-http::services::ServeDir` at the `/static` route.
